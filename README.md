# StarterExcelHomework

Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?

•	Theater plays are the most popular Kickstarter campaigns.

•	Roughly half of all Kickstarter campaigns are successful.

•	Kickstarter campaigns are least successful in December.

What are some limitations of this dataset?
•	We don’t know why some campaigns fail.

•	Not all campaigns request the same amount of funds or have the same funding period, so the data would need to be manipulated to find the average campaign time and goal, then take another look at how successful the campaigns are.

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

•	A pie chart to compare the sub categories, then compare that with a pie chart on which sub categories are most successful.

•	Compare date ranges of campaigns vs most successful campaigns to see if there is a relationship.

•	Compare the amount of funds requested vs. successful/failed campaigns to see if there is a correlation with asking price.
